# Reminstance
Reminstance or Rememeber Instance is a Game Creator 2 module, expand the Remember component functionality. It allow save and load Runtime Instances just using a component same Remember. This is the most easy wait to save and load prefab instances in Game Creator 2 

| At the moment the instances are only being used for prefabs of items that are dropped from the inventory.
| I'm working to include instantiation instructions from any action.
